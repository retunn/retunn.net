# Playing Pokémon Emerald for the fifth time 

Pokémon Emerald is the second Pokémon game I ever got, after Fire Red. I bought it during a trip with my family in September 2005, and I was so young that the year later I would have bought Sapphire, not knowing it was essentially the same game, let alone a less-perfected version of it.
